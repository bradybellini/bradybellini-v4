about: Hey, Iâ€™m Brady. I enjoy solving interesting problems and creating things
  with cool tech. I enjoy exploring the depths of the internet and
  breaking/making stuff along the way. (An Internet Explorer, you could say lol)
  I have experience as a networking and telecommunications technician, as a data
  analyst creating high level reports and finding trends, and a bit of military
  experience. Kind of everywhere, but it brings in a unique perspective on
  problem solving and communicating.
about_2: I love programming and everything that comes along with it. I enjoy the
  OOP paradigm and most of the languages that are built around it. Specifically,
  Python, Java/Kotlin and C++. If you understand the paradigm well, learning a
  new OOP language is more so about learning syntax and the nuances of the
  language vs starting from scratch, which is a big reason why I like it.
about_3: Like I briefly mentioned above, I like making and breaking things and
  that has led me to have quite a vast general knowledge of different
  technologies. I am tying to narrow it down a bit this year, so I don't fall
  into the "Jack of all trades, master of none" trap. I lean towards backend
  development and dabble in frontend a bit. I enjoy working with Python,
  Postgres, API's, and just general data analysis type of work. I also just
  enjoy working and exploring web technologies in general, and can pick up new
  stuff pretty quick. I am a learn by example/doing kind of person.
about_4: As far as future work goes, as long as the job is interesting or
  unique, I'm in. Working in a positive and laidback environment is important to
  me. I value the motivation and attitude of my work environment and co-workers
  over raw knowledge. If everyone is motivated and working towards a goal, then
  you can learn and work fast and efficiently, while having fun along the way.
about_5: If you read this far and think you would want to work along side me,
  reach out! Like I said above, I know quite a bit and am a fast learner. I
  don't see any value in just listing stuff above, beyond what I already have
  and I think having a conversation about it is much more meaningful and
  interesting. I can also provide you with a formal resume on request. It has
  personal info, so I don't really want it public. Anyway, if you just want to
  say hi and have a convo, that is also cool. You can use the form below, and I
  will respond via email. You can also reach out via the few social media sites
  I have in the top right. ðŸ˜€
